## Limitations of variant consequence predictors
Charles University in Prague, 2018

Abstract:

Thanks to numerous large-scale sequencing projects, the number of discovered genomic
variants is increasing. The key step in analyzing the variant data is the functional
annotation, since it helps researchers and clinicians to categorize, flter and prioritize
the variants for further research. This thesis discusses fve commonly-used variant
consequence predictors, ofers advice on how to use them and briefy goes through
the algorithms they employ. Moreover, various data formats as well as the human
reference genome and diferent genome annotations are described in the thesis. The
correctness of the reference is of great importance as all the predictors rely on it. This
thesis highlights some situations in which the results given by diferent predictors can
vary. All the tests were made using the Ensembl gene annotation (release 92) and the
GRCh38 reference assembly.
